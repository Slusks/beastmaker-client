# **BeastMaker - How to Play**

## **Objective**
BeastMaker is a strategic game where players create and evolve powerful creatures using a set of randomly assigned tiles. The goal is to build the strongest beast and outmatch your opponent in battle.

---

## **Setup**
1. Each player is randomly dealt **six tiles**.
2. Each tile represents part of a creature and contains:
   - A **name** and **short description** of a beast.
   - **Three attributes** from Speed, Strength, Cunning, Tenacity, or Special.
3. If the first hand **lacks at least one attribute** (including Special), the player may discard and redraw a new set of six tiles.
4. Players must **choose five tiles** to keep and **discard one** before the game begins.

---

## **Phase 1: Placing Your Tiles**
1. Players **take turns placing tiles**, one at a time, onto their board.
2. Each tile must be placed in one of the five available slots (**Speed, Strength, Cunning, Tenacity, Special**).
3. Once placed, a tile **cannot be moved** until the end of **Phase 3**.
4. Players can see each other's tile **names and descriptions**, but they **cannot see the tileâ€™s evolution options**.

---

## **Phase 2: Evolution**
1. Players may **evolve any number of their tiles** using one of two methods:
   - **Pressure Evolution:** Increases one attribute significantly but decreases another.
   - **Confer Evolution:** Provides a smaller stat increase but may grant a **Special ability**.
2. Evolution choices remain **hidden from the opponent**.

---

## **Phase 3: Final Adjustments**
1. After evolution, players may **simultaneously swap the positions** of their tiles to optimize their final creature design.
2. The final tile layouts are **not revealed until the end of this phase**.
3. No further changes can be made after swapping.

---

## **Phase 4: Battle!**
1. Once all tiles are placed and evolved, the AI creates a **unique creature** based on the final tile selections.
2. The two creatures battle, with the AI determining the winner based on their attributes and any special abilities.
3. The AI narrates the battle, revealing the outcome through a short story.

---

## **Winning the Game**
- The player whose creature wins the battle is declared the winner!
- Special abilities may influence key battle moments.

---

## **Strategy Tips**
- Think ahead about **which attributes** you want to prioritize.
- Consider **bluffing** by evolving unpredictably.
- Special abilities can **turn the tide of battle**, so use them wisely!

Enjoy crafting your ultimate beast in *BeastMaker*! ðŸ”¥
