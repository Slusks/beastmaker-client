BeastMaker Readme

Game Overview

BeastMaker is a strategic game where players build creatures by placing attribute tiles and evolving them. These creatures then battle based on their attributes, with special abilities influencing the outcome.

Game Phases

Phase 1 - Draw & Mulligan: Players draw six tiles and can redraw if missing an attribute.

Phase 2 - Tile Placement: Players take turns placing tiles into Speed, Strength, Cunning, Tenacity, or Special slots.

Phase 3 - Evolution: Players take turns evolving their tiles via Pressure or Confer.

Pressure: Increases one attribute significantly, decreases another slightly, and grants a new special ability.

Confer: Increases attributes moderately but retains the original special ability.

Players may use their Pressure evolutions on their opponentâ€™s tiles.

Players may only Confer their own tiles.

Phase 4 - Hidden Tile Swap: Players secretly rearrange their tiles.

Phase 5 - Reveal Final Configuration: All tiles are revealed in their final placements.

Phase 6 - Battle: The creatures battle using an AI algorithm based on their attributes.
